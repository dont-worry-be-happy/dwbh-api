# Contributing to patio

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible,
whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## Issue reports

Great issue Reports tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce
* Be specific!
* Give sample code if you can.
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We love thorough bug reports.

## Merge requests

Before submitting anything, please make sure:

* You're compiling the code with the proper JDK
* All tests are passing
* All code style checkers are passing
* Static analysis passes

Anything you need to run all those tasks can be found in the [README.md](README.md) document

Then whether you are fixing a bug or improving some part of the code please open an issue
following the issue reports guidelines.

We'll try to answer you asap to start the conversation about your contribution. And hopefully,
if everything seems ok, we'll be very happy to merge your code :)
